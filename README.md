🚀 **Your smart platform to connect clients and professionals efficiently**

## ✨ Vision

Helping people find trusted professionals in their local area, anytime. Whether it's automotive care, home services, pets, gardening or general maintenance — we bring practicality, trust and quality to your fingertips.

Our mission is to turn painful service requests into delightful, simple and safe experiences.

## 🧠 Why this project?

This project was born from a real need I faced in Ireland, working with on-demand services. The idea matured with time, blending personal experience, startup vision, and cutting-edge technologies like AI agents and smart authentication.

It's not just a system — it's a professional portfolio and a prototype of what a serious, scalable service startup could look like.
